My research focuses on software engineering and cybersecurity, with an emphasis on enhancing software reliability and quality through static analysis and dynamic testing. Additionally, I am exploring the application of artificial intelligence and large language models to support and advance program analysis and testing techniques.

If you are interested in my research, please feel free to contact me via email. I would be happy to discuss collaboration opportunities.
