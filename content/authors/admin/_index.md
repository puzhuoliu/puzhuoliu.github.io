My research focuses on cybersecurity and software engineering, with an emphasis on enhancing software (binary) reliability, quality and security through static analysis and dynamic testing. 
The security of devices in scenarios such as IoT, ICS, robots, UAV, and Embodied AI is a key focus.
Additionally, I am exploring the application of AI to support program analysis and testing techniques.

If you are interested in my research, please feel free to contact me via email. I would be happy to discuss collaboration opportunities.
